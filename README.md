# CS Hints

Has anyone ever asked you for a recommended list of coding resources? Well, our team has been asked many times over. This is why we decided to build CS Hints.

CS Hints cuts through the clutter to deliver coding resources built to help you master technical concepts. CS Hints allow users to search for, save, and share technical resources with friends or themselves.

When this project is finished users should be able to search for resources, pin those resources to their resource board, and sort resources into a personalized list for their own use or to share with others as a "recommendations".

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Installing Frontend

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
mkdir projects   // Do this where ever you prefer
cd projects/csHints
git clone https://github.com/rightbrainpapi/cs_Hints.git
cd csHints
code .          // This command opens up VS Code Editor
```

Once you have the code editor open:

```
- Navigate to left panel of VS code
- Click file icon to open file list
- Navigate to the index.html
- Right click or three finger click display options
- select Open with Live Server
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
